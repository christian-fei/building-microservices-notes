# Chapter 1
# Microservices

Microservices emerged as a trend starting from domain-driven design, continuous delivery, infrastructure automation etc in the past 10 years.
Microservices potentially help to deliver software faster and embrace new technologies.
Microservices are small, single services that work together and do one thing well.

## Small, and Focused on Doing One Thing Well

Microservices embrace the concept of Single responsability. A service is a responsability to a specific service/functionality.
The system boundaries are clearly drawn, which helps us to detect scope creep and wrong placement of responsability.

What is small though? For Jon Eaves its a functionality/service that can be rewritten in two weeks, for his context. Or put simply, when a codebase feels no longer "too big".

An interesting sentence I found is: 

> the smaller the service, the more you maximize the benefits and downsides of microser‐ vice architecture.

The communication between services can become complicated, handling timeouts, and all complexity from distributed systems.


## Autonomous

A microservice is a separate service, and the communication between these services is made through network calls.
A microservice can be deployed independently, ensuring low coupling between services.

As said, the communication is done via network calls, and the services communicate with an api that the service exposes.


## Key benefits

A microservice architecture has all the benefits and negatives of distributed systems and service-oriented architecture.

### Technology heterogenity

Since the services communicate with each through an API, the underlying technology or programming language are transparent from a caller point of view.
This leaves space for choosing the right technology for a specific job and don`t be forced to a certain stack or language.

> Microservices can allow you to more easily embrace different technologies

### Resilience

Microservices boundaries become the obvious bulkheads. If a service stops working or responds slowly, this issue can propagate through the system.

Networks can and will fail, as do services.

### Scaling

With monolithic applications we need to scale the entire monolithic for a specific part that needs more computing power.

With microservice we can scale them independently

### Ease of deployment

In monolithic applications a deployment requires the whole application to be updated in order to release the change.
This could mean that by introducing an issue on a part of the system can have lethal impact on an unrelated other part.
It is often a fearful operation.

With microservices we can redeploy a single service, independently, restricting the risk of failure.
It is only encouraged and definitely less fearful to deploy a change, meaning that we can release features to our customer right away.

### Organizational aligment

We know that teams working on smaller codebases tend to be more productive, and release more often.
Teams can work independently and collaborate on building a service / interaction with other services.

### Optimizing for Replaceability

The cost of replacing an old, legacy system is very high, and also the risk, and the knowledge.

With microservices the cost of replacing or rewriting a service is much easier to manage.



## Other decompositional techniques

### Shared Libraries

With libraries you can share functionality across teams and codebases.

You lose technology heterogenity, because most of the times you need to use the same language in which the library is writte.
Also, shared code used to communicate between services can become a point of coupling.

### Modules

see Erlang VM



## No Silver Bullet

Microservice architecture is definitely no silver bullet, you get the associated complexity of distributed systems.

Coming from a monolythic approach, you will need to invest in monitoring, resilience, deployment, testing, and scaling, etc.
