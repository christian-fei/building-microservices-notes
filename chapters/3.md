We will see how to think about the boundaries of your microservices.

## Introducing MusicCorp

MusicCorp is an online retailer. Their business model is a little nit behind the curve,
they believe their users are quite happy to wait for their music CDs at their doorstep,
they bet on quality over convenience.
They want to be able to change their business model quickly, and since they are online,
they are stoked to hear about that microservices thing.


## What makes a Good Service?

Loose coupling and high cohesion. That`s the key.

### Loose coupling

When services are loosely coupled, a change to one service should not require a change to another.
A loosely coupled service knows as little as possible about the collaborating service.

### High cohesion

Cohesion is about the responsability of a service. If the service is confused about its
roles and behaviour, low cohesion is the result. If we want to make a change to a specific
service that handles a responsability, well, we want to do it once, in one place.

We can achieve high cohesion by inspecting our problem domain and clearly define the
boundaries and responsabilities of the services
