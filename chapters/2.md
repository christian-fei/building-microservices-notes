## An evolutionary vision for the Architect

Requirements, tools, techinques shift more rapidly than they do for people who design and build buildings.

Thus, our architects need to shift their thinking away from creating the perfect end product, and instead focus on helping create a framework in which the right systems can emerge, and continue to grow as we learn more.

architects have a duty to ensure that the system is habitable for developers too.

## Zoning

An architect rather than specifying the different services, he ensures that the service boundaries can talk correctly to each other.

## A principled approach

Trade-offs are at the heart of system design and of microservice architectures. Which datastore do we pick,
how many different technology stacks should we pick at most, etc.

Principles can help us make these decisions easier.

### Strategic Goals

Or business goals. A company runs on profit, so it needs to optimize and innovate to get most out of the business.
The technologies used can be influenced by the company vision, to be able to adapt.

### Principles

Principles are rules that the company has defined in order to make different teams/sections align to the company vision.
One strategic goal of a company could be to reduce the time to market of features, or expand in another part of the world.
See Heroku`s 12 factor app for more info about modern principles on the heroku platform.


### Practices

Practices are technical, detailed guidance on how to perform a task to ensure a principle.

Like coding guidelines, structural architecture patterns, protocols to use for communication, etc..
