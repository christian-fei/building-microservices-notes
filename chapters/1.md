# Chapter 1
# Microservices

Microservices emerged as a trend starting from domain-driven design, continuous delivery, infrastructure automation etc in the past 10 years.
Microservices potentially help to deliver software faster and embrace new technologies.
Microservices are small, single services that work together and do one thing well.

## Small, and Focused on Doing One Thing Well

Microservices embrace the concept of Single responsability. A service is a responsability to a specific service/functionality.
The system boundaries are clearly drawn, which helps us to detect scope creep and wrong placement of responsability.

What is small though? For Jon Eaves its a functionality/service that can be rewritten in two weeks, for his context. Or put simply, when a codebase feels no longer "too big".

An interesting sentence I found is: "the smaller the service, the more you maximize the benefits and downsides of microser‚Äê vice architecture".

The communication between services can become complicated, handling timeouts, and all complexity from distributed systems.
