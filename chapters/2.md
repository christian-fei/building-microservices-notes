## An evolutionary vision for the Architect

Requirements, tools, techinques shift more rapidly than they do for people who design and build buildings.

Thus, our architects need to shift their thinking away from creating the perfect end product, and instead focus on helping create a framework in which the right systems can emerge, and continue to grow as we learn more.

architects have a duty to ensure that the system is habitable for developers too.

An architect rather than specifying the different services, he ensures that the service boundaries can talk correctly to each other.
